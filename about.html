            <p class = "biotext">Manning Farnsworth Snyder is an intern with the Greenville Drive, the Boston Red Sox High-A Minor League Baseball Affiliate, the Chief Operating Officer of NYU's Journal of Politics and International Affairs, and an Editor on NYU's Undergraduate Law Review. He also currently assists NYU Professor Eric Klinenberg, the Helen Gould Shepard Professor in Social Science Research, in research for his new book about the COVID-19 pandemic. He was formerly an Editorial Sports Writer for ESPN Coastal and the college football beat writer for The Citadel Athletics Department. For the summers following his freshman and sophomore years, Manning was a Teaching Assistant (TA) at Columbia University, where he helped teach classes on "Human Rights" and "Legal Reasoning." He was a Guest Writer for the University of Chicago Undergraduate Law Review and a “Proofreader” at Columbia University in their School of Professional Studies. Manning's work has been featured on CooperSquared.com, CitadelSports.com, and in NYU's Journal of Politics and International Affairs. </p> 

            <p class = "biotext">Manning is a student at New York University, majoring in Journalism and Sociology. He is graduating in December 2021. Originally from Charleston, South Carolina, Manning spent his freshman year of college in Paris, France at NYU Paris. During his time in Paris, Manning was the Editor-in-Chief of the NYU Paris Student Newspaper, where he was in charge of the day-to-day and publication responsibilities of the paper. He enjoys writing about politics, sports, and current events, as well as dabbling in baseball analytics, fundraising, speechwriting, and copy editing. Manning is passionate about First Amendment law and the intersection between law and media, but is always looking to write on a wide-range of topics. </p> 

            <p class = "biotext">Manning has been on the Dean's List every year of college. He won the César Award for academic excellence and civic spirit at NYU Paris. He was selected to participate in the NYU Leadership Honors class, an invitation-only course featuring top students from each department. He also completed “Baseball as a Road to God,” a selective course (seven students only) taught by Dr. John Sexton, NYU President Emeritus and former Dean of NYU Law School. In his free time, Manning can be found playing basketball and chess, reading, or watching (any and all) sports. </p>
