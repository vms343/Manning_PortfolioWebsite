            Dabo Swinney’s mouth wrote checks his team couldn’t cash.<br><br>

            The typically spirited Clemson football coach is rarely at a loss for words. He <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30368637/dabo-swinney-blasts-florida-state-postponing-game-clemson-player-tests-positive">speaks</a> his mind and often <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2020/04/dabo-swinney-doubles-down-on-covid-19-comments-god-can-stamp-this-out-as-quick-as-it-rose-up.html">defends</a> comments. Before Clemson’s New Year’s Day playoff matchup against Ohio State, Swinney once again made national headlines for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/12/21/ballots-college-football-coaches-amway-coaches-poll-panel/6548641002/">listing</a> Ohio State at number 11 on his final AP Coaches Poll. Despite the Buckeyes’ being undefeated and Big Ten champions, Swinney <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2020/12/28/dabo-swinney-defends-ranking-ohio-state-11-coaches-poll">said</a> that he didn’t rank any team in his top-10 that played less than nine games.<br><br>


            Then those very Buckeyes destroyed Clemson. And it wasn’t even close. His Tigers were dominated in the Sugar Bowl by Ohio State last week--a 49-28 loss to Swinney’s number-11-ranked team in the country. Clemson fans should hope and pray that Swinney talks less. It’s early 2021. Call it a resolution.<br><br>

            Clemson has become a college football powerhouse, making the playoff nearly every year and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football">winning</a> the ACC each of the last six years. The success speaks for itself and one would be a fool to say that Clemson is not among the best programs in the country. Tiger fans are now accustomed to winning and the school is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football">thriving</a> (through season ticket sales and fundraising) because of it.<br><br>

            Yet Swinney’s constant trash talking and unapologetic confidence makes their losses even <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2021/01/02/dabo-swinney-ohio-state-ranking-loss-twitter-reaction">sweeter</a> to college football fans. Yes, Swinney is responsible for much of Clemson’s success in recent years. But through Swinney’s “the best is the standard” <a href="https://www.si.com/college/clemson/football/best-is-the-standard-has-a-deep-meaning#:~:text=Our%20goal%20is%20to%20be,%2C%20the%20best%20player%2C%20whatever">motto</a>, he is also responsible for portraying Clemson’s image as a “holier than thou” football program. And amidst a global pandemic, Swinney’s comments and AP rankings were coined “bulletin board material” for an Ohio State program that couldn’t control the amount of games they played because of COVID-19.<br><br>

            Less talk. More wins.<br><br>

            Mr. Swinney, the success will speak for itself.</p>
